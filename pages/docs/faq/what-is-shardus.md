# What is Shardus?

Shardus is software that helps facilitate the development of decentralized, distributed applications. Think of it as a package that you install from the internet that provides tools for building applications.

Shardus can often get confused with programmable blockchains like [Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum). Shardus itself isn't a blockchain &mdash; **Shardus provides you with a powerful framework to easily build a scalable blockchain**. 

[Liberdus](https://liberdus.com) is an example of a decentralized blockchain that is built *using* shardus. Shardus handles all the complexity that exists behind the scenes in regards to blockchain applications.
