# How Can I Get Started With Shardus?

First, in order to begin building applications using Shardus, you'll need to be familiar with JavaScript, specifically [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

Additionally, you might want to take a look at the [shardus-crypto-utils](../tools/crypto-utils) package and the other [tools](../tools) defined in the documentation in order for you to have the best developer experience possible. Of course, we also recommend reading through relevant parts of documentation. 

After familiarizing yourself with the docs, take a look at the [examples](../examples) section and create your own network from scratch using the examples provided as guides.
