# Why Use Shardus?

Shardus abstracts away all of the complexity behind building distributed networks and provides a solution that can scale up and down linearly.

A single app developer could create a network with Shardus that scales to millions of users with no resource costs or infrastructure overhead. As long as users have the incentive to run nodes on your network, the infrastructure becomes the users and their hardware.

Big tech censorship is becoming more and more prevalent, and people are looking for decentralized platforms that support free speech. **You could be the one to build that platform.**
